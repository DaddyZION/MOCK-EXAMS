# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Scarcity || **Explanation:** Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem where unlimited wants and needs exceed limited resources. This forces individuals and societies to make choices about how to allocate resources efficiently.
2.  d) Money || **Explanation:** The factors of production are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Money is a medium of exchange but not a factor of production itself - it is used to purchase the factors of production.
3.  a) Gross Domestic Product || **Explanation:** GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year.
4.  c) Price equals marginal revenue || **Explanation:** In perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they accept the market price. Since they can sell any quantity at the market price, the price equals the marginal revenue for each additional unit sold.
5.  b) An increase in the general price level || **Explanation:** Inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. It reduces the purchasing power of money.

## Section B

1.  c) As price increases, quantity demanded decreases || **Explanation:** The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, assuming all other factors remain constant. As prices rise, consumers typically buy less of a good or service.
2.  b) The value of the next best alternative forgone || **Explanation:** Opportunity cost is a fundamental economic concept representing the value of the best alternative that must be given up when making a choice. It reflects the trade-offs inherent in every decision.
3.  d) Monopolistic competition || **Explanation:** Monopolistic competition is characterized by many sellers offering differentiated products that are close substitutes. Examples include restaurants, clothing stores, and hair salons.
4.  a) Government policy on taxation and spending || **Explanation:** Fiscal policy refers to government decisions about taxation and spending to influence economic activity. It is one of the main tools governments use to manage the economy alongside monetary policy.
5.  c) An improvement in technology || **Explanation:** An improvement in technology typically increases productivity and reduces production costs, which shifts the supply curve to the right (increases supply). This allows producers to supply more at each price level.

## Section C

1.  a) When one economic change leads to larger overall changes || **Explanation:** The multiplier effect occurs when an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in total economic output. For example, increased government spending can stimulate additional rounds of spending throughout the economy.
2.  c) Changing interest rates || **Explanation:** Monetary policy involves central bank actions to influence the money supply and interest rates. Changing interest rates is a primary tool of monetary policy used to control inflation and stimulate economic growth.
3.  b) Nominal GDP is measured in current prices, real GDP is adjusted for inflation || **Explanation:** Nominal GDP measures output using current market prices, while real GDP adjusts for inflation by using constant base-year prices. Real GDP provides a better measure of actual economic growth.
4.  a) The responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price || **Explanation:** Price elasticity of demand measures how sensitive consumer demand is to price changes. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
5.  c) Increase in aggregate demand || **Explanation:** Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply at full employment. This can be caused by increased consumer spending, government expenditure, or investment, leading to upward pressure on prices.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) The warming of Earth's atmosphere due to trapped heat || **Explanation:** The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back to space. This natural process keeps Earth warm enough to support life, but human activities have enhanced it.
2.  c) Carbon dioxide || **Explanation:** Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. It's released through burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities, and it persists in the atmosphere for centuries.
3.  b) The variety of life on Earth || **Explanation:** Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth at all levels, including genetic diversity within species, species diversity within ecosystems, and ecosystem diversity across the planet.
4.  b) A community of organisms and their environment || **Explanation:** An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. It includes both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components.
5.  b) A layer of gases that protects Earth from UV radiation || **Explanation:** The ozone layer is a region of Earth's stratosphere that contains high concentrations of ozone (O₃), which absorbs most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.

## Section B

1.  b) Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions || **Explanation:** Acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. These compounds react with water vapor to form sulfuric and nitric acids.
2.  c) Sunlight || **Explanation:** Sunlight is the primary source of energy for most ecosystems. Through photosynthesis, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy, which then flows through food chains and webs.
3.  b) The excessive growth of algae due to nutrient pollution || **Explanation:** Eutrophication occurs when water bodies receive excessive nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), leading to algal blooms that deplete oxygen and harm aquatic life.
4.  d) Solar energy || **Explanation:** Solar energy is a renewable energy source because it's continuously replenished by the sun. Unlike fossil fuels, it won't be depleted through use and produces no direct emissions.
5.  b) Human activities || **Explanation:** The main cause of deforestation is human activities, including agriculture, logging, urban development, and infrastructure projects. These activities clear forests at rates much faster than natural regeneration.

## Section C

1.  b) The movement of carbon through Earth's systems || **Explanation:** The carbon cycle describes how carbon moves between the atmosphere, land, oceans, and living organisms. It includes processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion.
2.  b) Meeting present needs without compromising future generations || **Explanation:** Environmental sustainability is the principle of meeting current human needs while ensuring that future generations can meet their own needs. It involves using resources responsibly and protecting environmental systems.
3.  a) Weather is short-term, climate is long-term || **Explanation:** Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions (days to weeks), while climate refers to long-term average weather patterns over decades or centuries in a particular region.
4.  b) The increase in concentration of toxins up the food chain || **Explanation:** Biomagnification is the process by which the concentration of toxins increases at each level of the food chain. Top predators accumulate the highest concentrations of these persistent substances.
5.  b) Melting ice reducing surface reflectivity || **Explanation:** This is a positive feedback loop where melting ice exposes darker surfaces (water or land) that absorb more heat than reflective ice, leading to more warming and more melting in a self-reinforcing cycle.

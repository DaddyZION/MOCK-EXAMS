# Answers

## Section A

1.  d) Database programming || **Explanation:** Database programming is not a programming paradigm but rather a domain or application area. Programming paradigms are fundamental styles of programming like object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming.
2.  a) Central Processing Unit || **Explanation:** CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, which is the primary component of a computer that executes instructions. It's often called the "brain" of the computer.
3.  b) Stack || **Explanation:** A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed. This is like a stack of plates where you add and remove from the top.
4.  b) O(log n) || **Explanation:** Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) because it repeatedly divides the search space in half. This makes it very efficient for searching sorted arrays.
5.  c) MySQL || **Explanation:** MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL for querying. MongoDB is a NoSQL document database, Redis is a key-value store, and Cassandra is a wide-column store.

## Section B

1.  b) To manage computer hardware and software resources || **Explanation:** The primary purpose of an operating system is to manage computer hardware and software resources, acting as an intermediary between applications and the computer hardware.
2.  c) Merge Sort || **Explanation:** Merge Sort has the best average-case time complexity of O(n log n) among the listed options. It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm that consistently performs well regardless of input data.
3.  b) Bundling data and methods together || **Explanation:** Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data together within a single unit (class), while hiding internal implementation details.
4.  b) HTTPS || **Explanation:** HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP that uses encryption (typically SSL/TLS) to protect data transmission over the internet.
5.  a) RAM is volatile, ROM is non-volatile || **Explanation:** RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory that loses its contents when power is removed, while ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile and retains its contents even without power.

## Section C

1.  c) It should be efficient and terminate || **Explanation:** A good algorithm should be efficient (using resources optimally), terminate (not run forever), be unambiguous (clear and precise), and be language-independent (expressible in any programming language).
2.  b) To track changes in code over time || **Explanation:** Version control systems like Git are designed to track changes in code over time, allowing developers to collaborate, maintain history, and manage different versions of their codebase.
3.  c) Singleton Pattern || **Explanation:** The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It's useful when exactly one object is needed across the system.
4.  b) It provides O(1) average-case lookup time || **Explanation:** The main advantage of hash tables is their O(1) average-case lookup time, making them very efficient for search operations. They use a hash function to map keys to array indices.
5.  d) Compilation testing || **Explanation:** Compilation testing is not a type of software testing. Unit testing tests individual components, integration testing tests component interactions, and system testing tests the complete system. Compilation is a separate process that converts source code to executable code.

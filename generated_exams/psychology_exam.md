# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Sigmund Freud || **Explanation:** Sigmund Freud is widely considered the father of psychoanalysis. He developed theories about the unconscious mind, defense mechanisms, and the structure of personality (id, ego, superego).
2.  b) Mental processes || **Explanation:** Cognitive psychology focuses on mental processes such as thinking, memory, perception, decision-making, and problem-solving. It examines how people process information and make sense of their world.
3.  b) Hippocampus || **Explanation:** The hippocampus is crucial for memory formation, particularly the formation of new memories and spatial navigation. Damage to this area can result in severe memory impairments.
4.  c) Learning through association || **Explanation:** Classical conditioning, discovered by Ivan Pavlov, involves learning through association between stimuli. A neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to produce a conditioned response.
5.  a) Abraham Maslow || **Explanation:** Abraham Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs, which suggests that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy from basic physiological needs to self-actualization. This theory is fundamental to humanistic psychology.

## Section B

1.  c) The study of mental processes and behavior || **Explanation:** Psychology is the scientific study of both mental processes (thoughts, emotions, perceptions) and behavior. It encompasses both observable actions and internal mental states.
2.  c) Experimental method || **Explanation:** The experimental method involves manipulating independent variables while controlling other factors to establish cause-and-effect relationships. It is the gold standard for psychological research when feasible.
3.  a) Confirmation bias || **Explanation:** Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information in ways that confirm our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. It can lead to errors in reasoning and decision-making.
4.  d) REM sleep || **Explanation:** REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is the stage most associated with vivid dreams. During this stage, brain activity is high, and most memorable dreams occur.
5.  a) Duration and capacity || **Explanation:** Short-term memory has limited duration (15-30 seconds) and capacity (7Â±2 items), while long-term memory has virtually unlimited duration and capacity. This is one of the key distinctions between these memory systems.

## Section C

1.  b) Cognitive-behavioral therapy || **Explanation:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is based on the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected.
2.  b) Neuroplasticity || **Explanation:** Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This ability allows the brain to adapt to new situations, learn new information, and recover from injury.
3.  c) Psychodynamic theory || **Explanation:** Psychodynamic theory, originated by Freud, suggests that behavior is largely determined by unconscious forces, childhood experiences, and internal conflicts between different parts of the personality.
4.  b) People are less likely to help when others are present || **Explanation:** The bystander effect occurs when people are less likely to offer help in an emergency when other people are present. This is often due to diffusion of responsibility and social influence.
5.  c) Actor-observer bias || **Explanation:** Actor-observer bias is the tendency to attribute our own behavior to external circumstances while attributing others' behavior to their internal characteristics. We have different perspectives on our own versus others' actions.

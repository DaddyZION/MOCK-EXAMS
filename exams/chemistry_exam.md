# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) 6 || **Explanation:** Carbon has an atomic number of 6, which means it has 6 protons in its nucleus. The atomic number is the defining characteristic of an element and determines its position on the periodic table.
2.  c) Helium || **Explanation:** Helium is a noble gas in Group 18 of the periodic table. Noble gases have complete outer electron shells, making them chemically inert under normal conditions.
3.  b) Ionic bond || **Explanation:** Sodium (Na) is a metal that loses an electron to become Na⁺, while chlorine (Cl) is a non-metal that gains an electron to become Cl⁻. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms an ionic bond.
4.  b) 7 || **Explanation:** At 25°C, pure water has a pH of 7, which is considered neutral. This means the concentration of H⁺ ions equals the concentration of OH⁻ ions (both are 10⁻⁷ M).
5.  a) 6.022 × 10²³ || **Explanation:** Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10²³ and represents the number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions) in one mole of a substance. This is a fundamental constant in chemistry.

## Section B

1.  c) CH₄ || **Explanation:** Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon with one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. It is the primary component of natural gas and follows the general formula for alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂).
2.  c) Evaporation || **Explanation:** Evaporation is the process by which molecules in a liquid state gain enough energy to enter the gas phase. This occurs at the surface of the liquid and can happen at any temperature below the boiling point.
3.  a) 1s² 2s² 2p⁴ || **Explanation:** Oxygen has 8 electrons. Following the aufbau principle, these electrons fill the orbitals in order: 1s² (2 electrons), 2s² (2 electrons), and 2p⁴ (4 electrons), totaling 8 electrons.
4.  d) Avogadro's Law || **Explanation:** Avogadro's Law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. This law is fundamental to the concept of the mole and gas stoichiometry.
5.  b) +6 || **Explanation:** In H₂SO₄, hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1 and oxygen has -2. For the compound to be neutral: 2(+1) + S + 4(-2) = 0, so S = +6. Sulfur has an oxidation state of +6 in sulfuric acid.

## Section C

1.  b) Moles of solute / Volume of solution in L || **Explanation:** Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the volume of solution in liters. This gives the concentration in mol/L or M, which is the standard unit for solution concentration.
2.  c) sp³ || **Explanation:** In methane (CH₄), carbon forms four single bonds with hydrogen atoms. This requires four hybrid orbitals, which are formed by mixing one s orbital and three p orbitals, resulting in sp³ hybridization and tetrahedral geometry.
3.  c) Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu || **Explanation:** This is a redox reaction where zinc is oxidized (loses electrons) from 0 to +2, and copper is reduced (gains electrons) from +2 to 0. Electrons are transferred between the species.
4.  b) The slowest step || **Explanation:** In a multi-step reaction, the rate-determining step is the slowest step because it limits the overall rate of the reaction. The reaction cannot proceed faster than its slowest step, similar to a bottleneck.
5.  c) A substance that speeds up the reaction without being consumed || **Explanation:** A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy. It participates in the reaction but is regenerated at the end, so it's not consumed overall.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  c) The Sun || **Explanation:** The Sun is the closest star to Earth at approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away. While Proxima Centauri is the closest star beyond our solar system, the Sun is our own star.
2.  b) 8 || **Explanation:** There are 8 planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
3.  b) Jupiter || **Explanation:** Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 88,695 miles (142,800 kilometers). It's more than twice as massive as all other planets combined.
4.  b) A unit of distance || **Explanation:** A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, approximately 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers). It's used to measure vast distances in space.
5.  c) The Moon's changing position relative to Earth and Sun || **Explanation:** The Moon's phases are caused by its changing position relative to Earth and the Sun. We see different portions of the Moon's illuminated side as it orbits Earth.

## Section B

1.  b) Milky Way || **Explanation:** Our galaxy is called the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy containing over 100 billion stars. It appears as a milky band of light across the night sky when viewed from Earth.
2.  b) A star exploding || **Explanation:** A supernova is the explosive death of a massive star. It occurs when a star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses, then explodes outward with tremendous energy.
3.  b) A region between Mars and Jupiter with many asteroids || **Explanation:** The asteroid belt is a region between Mars and Jupiter containing numerous asteroids. It's thought to be material that never formed into a planet due to Jupiter's gravitational influence.
4.  b) Comets have tails when near the Sun, asteroids don't || **Explanation:** Comets are "dirty snowballs" made of ice and dust that develop tails when approaching the Sun. Asteroids are rocky or metallic objects that don't develop tails.
5.  b) A cloud of gas and dust in space || **Explanation:** A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nebulae can be star-forming regions, planetary nebulae from dying stars, or supernova remnants.

## Section C

1.  b) A theory about the origin of the universe || **Explanation:** The Big Bang theory describes how the universe began from an extremely hot, dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since.
2.  a) Matter that doesn't emit light || **Explanation:** Dark matter is a form of matter that doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to telescopes. It's detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter.
3.  b) The stages of a star's life || **Explanation:** The main sequence describes the longest phase of a star's life, when it fuses hydrogen into helium in its core. Stars spend about 90% of their lives in this stable phase.
4.  b) The stretching of light waves due to expansion || **Explanation:** Redshift occurs when light waves are stretched (shifted toward the red end of the spectrum) due to the expansion of space between the source and observer. It's evidence for the expanding universe.
5.  b) The region where liquid water can exist || **Explanation:** The habitable zone, or "Goldilocks zone," is the region around a star where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface - not too hot, not too cold.

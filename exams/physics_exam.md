# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Newton || **Explanation:** The Newton (N) is the SI unit of force, defined as the force required to accelerate one kilogram of mass at one meter per second squared. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton.
2.  d) Speed || **Explanation:** Speed is a scalar quantity because it only has magnitude and no direction. Velocity, acceleration, and force are vector quantities as they have both magnitude and direction.
3.  a) 9.8 m/s² || **Explanation:** The standard acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/s² (or 9.81 m/s² more precisely). This value varies slightly depending on location and altitude.
4.  c) Newton's Third Law || **Explanation:** Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always occur in pairs - when one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force back.
5.  a) 3 × 10⁸ m/s || **Explanation:** The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s (more precisely 299,792,458 m/s). This is a fundamental constant in physics and represents the maximum speed at which information can travel.

## Section B

1.  b) KE = ½mv² || **Explanation:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, calculated as one-half times the mass times the square of the velocity. This formula shows that kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity.
2.  d) Radio waves || **Explanation:** In the electromagnetic spectrum, radio waves have the longest wavelengths (ranging from about 1 meter to several kilometers) and the lowest frequencies, while gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths.
3.  c) Ohm || **Explanation:** The Ohm (Ω) is the SI unit of electrical resistance, named after Georg Ohm. It represents the resistance of a conductor when a potential difference of one volt produces a current of one ampere.
4.  b) V = IR || **Explanation:** Ohm's Law states that voltage (V) equals current (I) times resistance (R). This fundamental relationship describes how voltage, current, and resistance are related in electrical circuits.
5.  b) It decreases || **Explanation:** When light passes from air into water, its speed decreases because water has a higher refractive index than air. Since the frequency remains constant, the wavelength must decrease to maintain the relationship c = fλ.

## Section C

1.  a) Electromagnetic induction || **Explanation:** Transformers operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where a changing magnetic field in the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil. This allows for voltage transformation in AC circuits.
2.  c) They are in opposite directions || **Explanation:** In simple harmonic motion, the acceleration is always directed toward the equilibrium position, while displacement is measured from the equilibrium position. This means they are always in opposite directions.
3.  a) 1 - T₂/T₁ || **Explanation:** The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given by η = 1 - T₂/T₁, where T₁ is the temperature of the hot reservoir and T₂ is the temperature of the cold reservoir (both in Kelvin). This represents the theoretical maximum efficiency.
4.  b) Position and momentum cannot be determined precisely simultaneously || **Explanation:** Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely we know one, the less precisely we can know the other.
5.  b) The angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is 90° || **Explanation:** The critical angle is the angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction is 90°. Beyond this angle, total internal reflection occurs, and no light is transmitted into the less dense medium.

# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) Asia || **Explanation:** Asia is the largest continent by both area and population, covering about 30% of the Earth's land area. It extends from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Ural Mountains in the west.
2.  c) Canberra || **Explanation:** Canberra is the capital of Australia, located in the Australian Capital Territory. It was specially designed and built as the national capital, chosen as a compromise between the rival cities of Sydney and Melbourne.
3.  b) Nile River || **Explanation:** The Nile River is traditionally considered the longest river in the world at approximately 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles). It flows through northeastern Africa, primarily through Egypt and Sudan.
4.  c) Himalayas || **Explanation:** Mount Everest, the world's highest peak at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet), is located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and Tibet (China). The Himalayas are the highest mountain range in the world.
5.  b) Pacific Ocean || **Explanation:** The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean, covering about one-third of the Earth's surface. It extends from the Arctic in the north to the Antarctic in the south, bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.

## Section B

1.  c) Equator || **Explanation:** The Equator is the imaginary line that circles the Earth at 0Â° latitude, dividing it into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. It is equidistant from both the North and South poles.
2.  b) Russia || **Explanation:** Russia spans 11 time zones, making it the country with the most time zones in the world. This vast expanse stretches from Eastern Europe across northern Asia to the Pacific Ocean.
3.  c) Africa || **Explanation:** The Sahara Desert is located in North Africa and is the world's largest hot desert. It covers approximately 9 million square kilometers, roughly the size of the United States.
4.  b) Strait of Gibraltar || **Explanation:** The Strait of Gibraltar is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas and separates Europe (Spain) from Africa (Morocco). It is only about 14 kilometers wide at its narrowest point.
5.  b) Vatican City || **Explanation:** Vatican City is the smallest country in the world by both area and population, covering only 0.17 square miles (0.44 square kilometers). It is entirely enclosed by Rome, Italy.

## Section C

1.  b) Mediterranean || **Explanation:** The Mediterranean climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This climate type is found in regions like the Mediterranean Basin, parts of California, Chile, South Africa, and Australia.
2.  a) Volcanoes and earthquakes || **Explanation:** The Ring of Fire is a region around the Pacific Ocean where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. It is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, volcanic arcs, and volcanic belts.
3.  c) Earth's axial tilt || **Explanation:** Earth's seasons are caused by the planet's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees. As Earth orbits the sun, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year.
4.  b) Plate boundary || **Explanation:** A plate boundary is the edge where two or more tectonic plates meet. These boundaries are sites of significant geological activity, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and mountain formation.
5.  a) Tundra || **Explanation:** The tundra biome is characterized by permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil), extremely cold temperatures, and limited vegetation. It is found in the Arctic regions and high mountain areas.

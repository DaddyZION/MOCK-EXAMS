# Answers

## Section A

1.  b) The study of speech sounds || **Explanation:** Phonetics is the branch of linguistics that studies the physical properties of speech sounds, including how they are produced, transmitted, and perceived.
2.  b) The smallest unit of meaning in language || **Explanation:** A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in language. For example, "cats" contains two morphemes: "cat" (the root) and "-s" (indicating plural).
3.  b) The study of sentence structure || **Explanation:** Syntax is the branch of linguistics that studies how words combine to form phrases and sentences. It examines the rules governing sentence structure.
4.  d) Astrology || **Explanation:** Astrology is not a branch of linguistics; it's the study of celestial bodies and their supposed influence on human affairs. The other options are all legitimate branches of linguistics.
5.  b) A unit of sound that can distinguish words || **Explanation:** A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning between words. For example, /p/ and /b/ are different phonemes because they distinguish "pat" from "bat."

## Section B

1.  b) Prescriptive prescribes rules, descriptive describes how language is used || **Explanation:** Prescriptive grammar tells people how they should speak or write, while descriptive grammar describes how people actually use language without making value judgments.
2.  a) The study of how context affects meaning || **Explanation:** Pragmatics studies how context, speaker intention, and social factors affect the interpretation of meaning in communication beyond the literal meaning of words.
3.  b) A regional or social variety of a language || **Explanation:** A dialect is a variety of a language that differs in pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary from other varieties, often associated with a particular region or social group.
4.  b) The idea that humans have an innate capacity for language || **Explanation:** Universal Grammar, proposed by Noam Chomsky, suggests that humans are born with an innate capacity for language acquisition and that all languages share certain fundamental properties.
5.  b) Changes in word meaning over time || **Explanation:** Semantic change refers to the evolution of word meanings over time. Words can broaden, narrow, or completely change their meanings through various linguistic and social processes.

## Section C

1.  b) Ferdinand de Saussure || **Explanation:** Ferdinand de Saussure is considered the father of modern linguistics. His work established linguistics as a scientific discipline and introduced key concepts like the distinction between langue and parole.
2.  c) The distinction is often political rather than linguistic || **Explanation:** The distinction between language and dialect is often based on political, social, or cultural factors rather than purely linguistic ones. The saying "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy" reflects this reality.
3.  b) Alternating between languages or dialects || **Explanation:** Code-switching is the practice of alternating between two or more languages or dialects within a single conversation or even within a single sentence, common in multilingual communities.
4.  b) There's an optimal time for language learning || **Explanation:** The critical period hypothesis suggests there's an optimal time period (typically before puberty) for language acquisition, after which it becomes much more difficult to achieve native-like proficiency.
5.  b) Language influences thought || **Explanation:** Linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, suggests that the language we speak influences how we think and perceive the world around us.

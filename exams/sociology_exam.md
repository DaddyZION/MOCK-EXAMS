# Answers

## Section A

1.  c) Auguste Comte || **Explanation:** Auguste Comte is considered the founding father of sociology. He coined the term "sociology" and believed that society could be studied scientifically using the same methods as the natural sciences.
2.  b) The process of learning society's norms and values || **Explanation:** Socialization is the lifelong process through which individuals learn the norms, values, behaviors, and social skills appropriate to their society. It begins in childhood and continues throughout life.
3.  b) Ethnocentrism || **Explanation:** Ethnocentrism is the tendency to judge other cultures by the standards of one's own culture, often viewing one's own culture as superior. This can lead to misunderstanding and prejudice toward other cultures.
4.  a) The arrangement of society into layers || **Explanation:** Social stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of society into different layers or strata based on factors like wealth, power, prestige, race, gender, or other characteristics.
5.  b) Charles Horton Cooley || **Explanation:** Charles Horton Cooley developed the concept of the "looking-glass self," which suggests that our self-concept is shaped by how we think others perceive us. We see ourselves reflected in others' reactions to us.

## Section B

1.  b) Folkways are customs, mores are strongly held norms || **Explanation:** Folkways are informal norms governing everyday behavior (like table manners), while mores are strongly held norms that are considered essential to society's welfare (like prohibitions against murder or incest).
2.  b) Participant observation || **Explanation:** Participant observation is a research method where the researcher becomes part of the group being studied, observing behavior from within. This allows for deep understanding of social dynamics and cultural practices.
3.  a) A state of normlessness || **Explanation:** Anomie, according to Durkheim, is a condition where social norms are unclear or absent, leading to confusion and deviance. It often occurs during periods of rapid social change.
4.  c) Traditional authority || **Explanation:** Traditional authority, according to Max Weber, is based on established customs and traditions. Leaders gain authority through inheritance or long-standing cultural practices rather than elections or personal charisma.
5.  b) Changing one's social position || **Explanation:** Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups within the social stratification system. It can be upward, downward, or horizontal, and may occur within a generation or between generations.

## Section C

1.  c) Conflict theory || **Explanation:** Conflict theory, associated with Karl Marx and others, emphasizes the role of conflict between different groups in society. It focuses on how power differences lead to inequality and social change.
2.  a) Achieved status is earned, ascribed status is given at birth || **Explanation:** Achieved status is a social position that a person attains through their own efforts and choices (like becoming a doctor), while ascribed status is assigned at birth or involuntarily (like race or gender).
3.  c) Bureaucratic ritualism || **Explanation:** Bureaucratic ritualism refers to the tendency of bureaucrats to focus so much on following rules and procedures that they lose sight of the organization's original goals, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility.
4.  a) If people define situations as real, they are real in their consequences || **Explanation:** The Thomas theorem states that people's perceptions of reality shape their behavior, regardless of whether those perceptions are accurate. If people believe something is real, they act on that belief.
5.  c) Assimilation || **Explanation:** Assimilation is the process by which members of a minority group adopt the cultural practices of the dominant group, often losing their original cultural identity in the process. This contrasts with multiculturalism, which preserves cultural diversity.
